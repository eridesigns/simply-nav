# Simply Navigation
This is a dead simple lightweight navigation built with flexbox and vanilla JavaScript
[Demo is here](https://codepen.io/obscuredetour/full/XxNWLY/)

## The gist

- No dependencies. Built using Flexbox & vanilla JavaScript only.
- Fully responsive.
- Easy close mobile menu. Mobile menu closable via entire top row and right side page overlay.
- Mobile menu closes when selecting a link. Useful so the mobile user doesn't have to close the menu after selecting an anchor link on the current page. Try by opening the [mobile menu](https://codepen.io/obscuredetour/full/XxNWLY/) and click on the 'Last Section'.


## Customizable

- Breakpoint variable - default at 800px.
- Sticky navigation bar available, [try it](https://codepen.io/obscuredetour/full/XxNWLY/).
